		<title>Rural And Remote Australians On Telstra Cannot Register</title>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many rural Australians aren't able to register for the app at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to register for COVIDSafe, users need to be sent an SMS verification. This two-factor authentication (2FA) is for security purposes and in general is a good feature of the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this becomes problematic if you live in an area with patchy or no mobile service. And this is the issue that many rural Australians are now facing. If you can't get the SMS, you can't use COVIDSafe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For rural Aussies – or even just those who live in a mobile black spot – who are on plans with Vodafone and Optus, excluding prepaid, this isn't a problem. With these providers, they're able to still receive the verification text because these telcos offer SMS Over WiFi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, users who are with Telstra or some Mobile virtual Network Operator (MVNO) resellers don't have the SMS over WiFi option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2020/05/telstra-sms-over-wifi-launch/"&gt;https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2020/05/telstra-sms-over-wifi-launch/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Telstra customers in areas that do not have mobile coverage are unable to send or receive SMS over WiFi. We have been working to introduce this capability into the network and will now accelerate the work required. We are also working closely with the DTA on alternative methods for the COVIDSafe app to send an authentication code,&amp;quot; a Telstra spokesperson said in an email to Gizmodo Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The government is aware that Telstra handsets presently do not support SMS over wi-fi, meaning that those in areas with poor mobile coverage may experience challenges in completing the process to download and register the COVIDSafe App (as the process involves receiving a code via SMS),&amp;quot;a spokesperson for the Minister for Communications, Cyber Safety and the Arts, Paul Fletcher, said in an email to Gizmodo Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Telstra's statement indicated that it was working on introducing SMS Over Wifi, no time frame was given. Telstra has now confirmed with Gizmodo Australia that the feature has begun rolling out on iOS and Samsung devices as of today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;SMS over WiFi updates for customers’ smartphones have gone live overnight and will roll out progressively over the next seven days. Some Telstra customers will already see the functionality available on their devices.&amp;quot; said a Telstra spokesperson in an email tp Gizmodo Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content>&lt;h1 id="overview"&gt;Overview&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been no roadmap published by the DTA. We sometimes hear through the media that an update may be coming, but we don't know what that update will contain until it is published, and then it is just the brief release notes on the app stores or we compare the decompiled app with the previous version. The only certain item that has been mentioned several times is that they are planning to integrate the Exposure Notification APIs developed by Apple and Google. But there has been no mention or discussion by the DTA on what this integration may involve.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>CVE-2020-12717 - iOS Bluetooth Denial of Service</title>
		<link href="https://covidsafe.watch/issue-register/cve-2020-12717-ios-bluetooth-denial-of-service" />
		<updated />
		<content>&lt;h1 id="overview"&gt;Overview&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COVIDSafe for iOS, versions 1.0 and 1.1 contain a denial of service vulnerability, inherited from the OpenTrace code. The coding error allows an attacker within Bluetooth range to crash the application. This causes no further records of contacts to be stored until the user manually reopens the application. Only when the exploit is stopped, or the user is out of range, is the application able to run again. If attackers (such as a misguided group of activists) were motivated to disrupt the COVIDSafe system, they could use this bug to prevent contact exchanges in busy, popular areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;?# Youtube 7UdVHB1ohNo /?&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This bug also affected Singapore’s TraceTogether, Alberta’s ABTraceTogether and Poland’s ProteGO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a fairly obvious bug that should have been picked up in an automated scan and/or an in-depth security review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The model that governments have chosen to build on OpenTrace has made the disclosure process extremely painful. It seems as though each government received a code drop of OpenTrace at some point in time, and from there on there was little to no communication. There’s no central repository they all build upon, no process for communicating bugs up or downstream, and in fact no security contacts that we could find at all. we tried contacting each entity separately through the traditional support request forms, but did not get a response from any, apart from the DTA who we happened to have a specific email address for. If they had followed an established upstream/downstream model or all contributed to a monorepo, there would have been significant advantages to all involved.
As much as was my wish, it seemed impossible to coordinate disclosure between all affected entities. And there could be more affected applications that we just don’t know about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id="timeline"&gt;Timeline&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The response from the disclosure of this particular vulnerability was very positive:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;6/5/20 22:57: Information of bug shared with DTA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;7/5/20 07:54: Response confirming receipt and that they were looking into it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;7/5/20 13:13: DTA confirmed the bug and that they would have a fix in the next release&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8/5/20 19:03: DTA said they had fixed the bug and shared a timeframe for fix, and that upgrade advice for users would be settled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;14/5/20: Fix released to users in the App Store.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fast response, continuous updates with a good outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vision and hearing-impaired people are also at a disadvantage in using the app. Testing by disability groups has found that it is not fully screen reader accessible, and there is no known Auslan guide on access and use. There is an urgent need for immediate consultation with this community to enable accessibility features to be built into the app design and inform any future iterations&lt;/p&gt;
