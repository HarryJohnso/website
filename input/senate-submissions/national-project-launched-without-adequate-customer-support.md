Title: National project launched without adequate customer support
Status: Work in progress
--

The app store reviews contain hundreds of negative reviews, none of which are being addressed. There is no social media team where users could reach out for support. 

There's absolutely no way to get support ("faq and help buttons") until you have registered. Which means if people can't register they just give up and don't know where to turn.
