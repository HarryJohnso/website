CVEIdentifier: CVE-2020-12717

# Overview

COVIDSafe for iOS, versions 1.0 and 1.1 contain a denial of service vulnerability, inherited from the OpenTrace code. The coding error allows an attacker within Bluetooth range to crash the application. This causes no further records of contacts to be stored until the user manually reopens the application. Only when the exploit is stopped, or the user is out of range, is the application able to run again. If attackers (such as a misguided group of activists) were motivated to disrupt the COVIDSafe system, they could use this bug to prevent contact exchanges in busy, popular areas.
