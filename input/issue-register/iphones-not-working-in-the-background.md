> Jim Mussared is one Australian developer who's been working on uncovering the app's flaws to ensure it's doing what it's meant to. For him, it's made one thing particularly clear â€” the DTA hasn't been easy to work with when it comes to disclosing bugs.

> "Seeing the source code allows us to do a direct comparison to the Singapore [TraceTogether] code," Mussared said to Gizmodo Australia over email.
>
> "One very clear result of this is that there were zero functional changes to the iOS BLE backgrounding behaviour (CentralController.swift). We know that the Singapore team knew that background-to-background iPhone didn't work, so any claims by the DTA that they 'fixed it' indicate that either they never actually tested [or] investigated it, or their testing methodology was flawed."
